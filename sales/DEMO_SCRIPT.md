# MOVEAROUND TMS — DEMO SCRIPT

## What to Say Out Loud

Use these exact phrases during demo:

### 1. Ticket Review
**Point to ticket with confidence badge:**
> "This ticket looks wrong. The net weight deviates 103% from this site's historical baseline. See the red badge? That's our system flagging potential scale errors."

### 2. Exceptions List
**Point to exceptions page:**
> "These are the top issues. Ranked by estimated financial impact. We're showing you exactly where revenue is at risk, not just data."

### 3. Revenue at Risk
**Point to revenue risk dashboard:**
> "This is the money at risk. Estimated revenue exposure based on historical variance. These aren't guesses—these are calculated risks based on actual patterns."

### 4. Audit Packet
**Point to audit packet generator:**
> "This is what we give auditors. Complete evidence packets with tickets, timestamps, confidence scores, and anomaly explanations. Everything they need in one place."
