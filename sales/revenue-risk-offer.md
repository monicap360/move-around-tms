# Transportation Revenue Risk Audit
**One-Page Offer Document**

---

## The Problem You Can't See

**Silent revenue loss from ticket data quality issues you don't track.**

Your TMS stores data, but doesn't defend it. That means:
- **Disputed tickets** you can't defend → Lost revenue
- **Revenue leaks** from undetected anomalies → Margin erosion
- **Compliance gaps** → Audit exposure
- **Operational blind spots** → Efficiency losses

**Traditional TMS systems don't track data confidence. They store data, but they don't defend it.**

- **Data confidence assessment** - Field-level confidence scores vs. historical baselines
