**Subject:** Quick question about ticket disputes

Hi [First Name],

I help transportation executives quantify revenue they're losing from ticket disputes and data quality issues they can't see.

Most TMS systems store data, but don't defend it. That means disputed tickets go unresolved, revenue leaks go undetected, and compliance gaps compound.

We've built a Revenue Risk Audit that identifies these issues in 30-60 days. It's not software—it's a focused analysis that shows exactly where you're losing money and how to protect it.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this makes sense for [Company Name]?

Best,  
[Your Name]
