# Revenue Shield: Service → Product Mapping
**Create AFTER first 2-3 deals**

This document maps audit service steps to future TMS product features.

## Service → Product Mapping

**Purpose:** Document which audit steps can be automated and productized after proving value through services.

## Audit Steps → TMS Features

| Audit Step (Manual) | Future TMS Feature | Priority | Status |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Data confidence scoring (manual analysis) | Automated confidence scoring dashboard | High | ✅ Exists |
| Anomaly detection (manual comparison) | Automated anomaly alerts | High | ✅ Exists |
| Evidence packet generation (manual assembly) | One-click evidence packet generator | High | ✅ Exists |
| Revenue leakage analysis (manual calculation) | Financial intelligence dashboard | High | ✅ Exists |
| Executive summary (manual report) | Automated PDF report generator | Medium | ⚠️ Needs work |
| Baseline calculation (manual) | Automated baseline generation | Medium | ⚠️ Partial |
| Dispute risk scoring (manual) | Automated dispute risk scoring | Medium | ⚠️ Needs work |

## Client Questions → Dashboard Needs

**Common client questions from audits:**
1. "Which tickets need attention first?" → Exception Queue Dashboard ✅
2. "How confident are we in this data?" → Confidence Score Dashboard ✅
3. "What's our dispute exposure?" → Risk Scoring Dashboard ⚠️
4. "Can we see trends over time?" → Historical Analytics ⚠️
5. "How do we prevent this?" → Automated Workflow Rules ⚠️

## Manual Steps → Future Automation

**Currently manual (acceptable for services):**
- PDF report generation
- Baseline calculation setup
- Risk scoring calibration
- Client-specific customizations

**Must automate for product:**
- Confidence scoring (real-time)
- Anomaly detection (automated alerts)
- Evidence packet generation (one-click)
- Executive summaries (automated)

## Product Feature Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current - Service Support):**
- ✅ Data confidence scoring
- ✅ Anomaly detection
- ✅ Evidence packet generator (basic)
- ⚠️ Exportable summaries (PDF) - needs improvement

**Phase 2 (After 3-5 deals - Productization):**
- Automated report generation
- Real-time confidence scoring
- Automated anomaly alerts
- Client self-service portal

**Phase 3 (After 10+ deals - Scale):**
- Multi-tenant dashboard
- Automated baseline updates
- Workflow automation
- API access for integrations

## What NOT to Build (Yet)

**Don't build until:**
- You have 3+ paying audit clients
- You've documented common patterns
- You know what features close deals
- You understand pricing sensitivity

**Stop building:**
- Generic TMS features
- Features no client asked for
- "Nice to have" dashboards
- Competitive parity features

---

## Success Criteria for Productization

**Move from service to product when:**
- ✅ 3+ successful audit engagements
- ✅ Clear patterns in client needs
- ✅ Validated pricing ($25k-$75k works)
- ✅ Documented common questions/needs
- ✅ Client interest in ongoing service

---

**Remember: The product scales after the pain is monetized. Services first → productized second.**
