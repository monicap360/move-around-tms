# Revenue Risk Audit
## What You're Losing Without Knowing It

**MoveAround TMS | Executive Protection Service**

---

## The Invisible Problem

Your TMS is bleeding money from **undetected data quality issues** that compound into:
- **Disputed tickets** you can't defend → Lost revenue
- **Revenue leaks** from anomalies → Margin erosion  
- **Compliance gaps** → Audit exposure
- **Operational blind spots** → Efficiency losses

**Traditional TMS systems don't track data confidence. They store data, but they don't defend it.**

## What We Find in 7 Days

### 🔍 **Data Quality Risks**
Tickets with low confidence scores, anomalies flagged for review, driver/site behavioral patterns indicating risk.

### 💰 **Revenue Leak Detection**  
Financial discrepancies, margin erosion from cost allocation issues, profitability gaps in routes/drivers/customers.

### ⚖️ **Dispute Defense Gaps**
Missing evidence packets, incomplete audit trails, weak documentation for billing disputes.

### 📊 **Operational Blind Spots**
Exception queue priorities, confidence scoring by field, anomaly severity rankings.
