# Revenue Risk Audit: Sales Script
**MoveAround TMS | Executive Outreach**

---

## Opening (30 seconds)

**"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name] with MoveAround TMS. I help transportation executives find revenue they're losing without knowing it. Do you have 5 minutes?"**

**If yes, continue. If no, ask:**
*"When would be a better time? I have something that could save your company significant money."*

---

## The Hook (1 minute)

**"Here's what I've found: Most TMS systems track data, but they don't defend it. That means:**
- **Disputed tickets** you can't defend → Lost revenue
- **Revenue leaks** from undetected anomalies → Margin erosion
- **Compliance gaps** → Audit exposure
- **Operational blind spots** → Efficiency losses

**The question is: How much are you losing without knowing it?"**

**Pause for response.**

## The Solution (2 minutes)

**"We've built something different. Our Revenue Risk Audit uses proprietary data intelligence to find what traditional TMS systems miss:**

1. **Data Confidence Scoring** - We compare your tickets against your own historical baselines (driver 30-day, site 90-day). If something deviates, we flag it.

2. **Anomaly Detection** - We rank issues by financial impact, not just volume. You know what to fix first.

3. **Financial Intelligence** - Real cost allocation, not estimates. We show you where margins are eroding.

4. **Evidence Automation** - We auto-generate dispute defense packets. When a ticket is challenged, you have everything ready.

5. **Exception Queue** - Prioritized list of what needs attention, ranked by dollar exposure.

**This isn't available in Axon, Rose Rocket, or any other TMS. It's proprietary to MoveAround."**

## The Offer (1 minute)

**"Here's what I'm proposing:**

**A 7-day Revenue Risk Audit. We get read-only access to your data, run our analysis, and deliver:**
- Executive summary of top 10 revenue risks
- Financial exposure estimates
- Prioritized action plan
- Evidence packet samples

**Investment: $25,000 - $75,000, based on your volume and complexity.**

**Typical ROI: 3-10x the audit cost in the first year. Often, we find enough recoverable revenue or preventable losses to pay for the audit multiple times over."**

---

## The Guarantee (30 seconds)

**"Here's my guarantee: If we don't find at least $50,000 in recoverable revenue or preventable losses, the audit is free. That's how confident I am in our system."**

*Terms: Minimum 1000 tickets analyzed, 6-month historical data required.*

---

## The Close (1 minute)

**"The question isn't whether you have revenue risks—every fleet does. The question is: Do you want to know about them before they compound?**

**Here's what I need from you:**
1. **30-minute discovery call** - I'll understand your operations and customize the audit scope
2. **Read-only data access** - 7 days, full transparency
3. **Executive presentation** - We'll show you exactly what we found and what to do about it

**If you're interested, I can schedule the discovery call this week. Does [Day/Time] work for you?"**

## Objection Handling

### **"We already have a TMS"**
*"That's perfect. We work with your existing TMS. We just analyze the data you're already generating. We're not replacing your system—we're making it smarter."*

### **"We don't have budget"**
*"I understand. That's why we offer a revenue share model. If we find recoverable revenue, we take a percentage. If we don't, you don't pay. Zero risk."*

### **"We're too busy"**
*"That's exactly why you need this. The audit takes 7 days, and we handle everything. You get a prioritized list of what to fix first. It saves you time, not costs you time."*

### **"How is this different from what we already do?"**
*"Great question. Traditional TMS audits look at processes. We look at data quality. We use AI to compare your tickets against your own historical baselines. If something deviates, we flag it with a confidence score. That's proprietary to MoveAround."*

### **"We need to think about it"**
*"Absolutely. Here's what I'll do: I'll send you a one-pager with the details. Can I follow up in [X days]? Also, I can share a case study from a similar fleet if that would help."*
