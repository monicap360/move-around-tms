# Customer Interview Script (Internal)

Goal: Validate product-market fit, pricing sensitivity, and missing must-haves for
dump truck and aggregate hauling operations. This is not customer-facing.

## Intro (5 mins)
- Thanks for taking time. We are building software specifically for dump truck and aggregate hauling.
- This is not a sales call; I want to learn your workflow so we build what actually helps.
- This should take about 20 minutes. Is that still okay?

## Current Process and Pain Points (10 mins)
- Walk me through how a load is scheduled, dispatched, and billed today.
- Where do delays or mistakes usually happen?
- How do you track materials (tons/yards) for billing and job costing?
- How do you handle overweight permits today?

## Reaction to the Concept (5 mins)
- If this existed today, would it solve your biggest frustrations?
- Which part would help you most?
- What is missing that would be a deal-breaker?

## Pricing Sensitivity (5 mins)
- What do you spend per month on dispatch or operations tools now?
- At $85-$150 per truck, is this a no-brainer, maybe, or too expensive?
- Who else would need to approve this purchase?

## Close
- This was very helpful. Can I follow up in a few months with a demo?
- Do you know anyone else who should see this?
