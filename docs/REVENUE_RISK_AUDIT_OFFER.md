# Revenue Risk Audit
## What You're Losing Without Knowing It

**MoveAround TMS | Executive Protection Service**

## The Problem You Can't See

Your TMS is bleeding money. Not from obvious errors—from **invisible data quality issues** that compound into:

- **Disputed tickets** you can't defend
- **Revenue leaks** from undetected anomalies  
- **Compliance gaps** that trigger audits
- **Operational blind spots** costing efficiency

**Traditional TMS systems don't track data confidence. They store data, but they don't defend it.**

## What We Find in 7 Days

Our **Revenue Risk Audit** uses proprietary data intelligence to uncover:

### 🔍 **Data Quality Risks**
- Tickets with low confidence scores (deviating from historical norms)
- Anomalies flagged for manual review
- Driver/site behavioral patterns indicating risk

### 💰 **Revenue Leak Detection**
- Financial discrepancies in ticket calculations
- Margin erosion from undetected cost allocation issues
- Profitability gaps in specific routes, drivers, or customers

### ⚖️ **Dispute Defense Gaps**
- Missing evidence packets for high-value tickets
- Incomplete audit trails for compliance
- Weak documentation for billing disputes

### 📊 **Operational Blind Spots**
- Exception queue priorities (what needs attention first)
- Confidence scoring by field (which data to trust)
- Anomaly severity rankings (where to intervene)
