# Strategic Positioning - Mexico Launch

## Strategic Implications

### Primary Advantage
MoveAround occupies the "Goldilocks Zone" between overly complex/expensive US systems and limited, scalability-challenged local Mexican solutions.

### Critical Success Factors for Mexico
- **Localization Balance:** Enough Mexican compliance without over-engineering.
- **Pricing Strategy:** Premium to local providers but justified by better technology.
- **Partnership Model:** Collaborate with Mexican implementation partners.
- **Hybrid Support:** Digital-first with strategic local presence.

### Chosen Niche
Focus on US–Mexico manufacturing 3PLs that need cross-border automation and compliance readiness without enterprise-heavy tooling.

## Execution Notes
- Prioritize compliance features that remove sales objections (CFDI 4.0, Carta Porte 3.0).
- Avoid heavy customization before first 2–3 Mexico pilots.
- Position value in automation ROI and audit readiness, not “perfect AI.”
