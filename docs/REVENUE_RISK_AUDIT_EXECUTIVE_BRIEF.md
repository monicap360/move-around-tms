**MoveAround TMS | Protecting What You've Built**

## The Question Every Executive Should Ask

**"How much revenue am I losing from data quality issues I can't see?"**

Most TMS systems answer: *"We don't know."*

MoveAround answers: *"Let us show you—in 7 days."*

---

- Identify revenue leaks before they compound?

## The Technology Behind It

**MoveAround's proprietary systems:**

1. **Data Confidence Scoring** - Compares new data against driver (30d) and site (90d) baselines
2. **Anomaly Detection** - Flags deviations with severity rankings
3. **Financial Intelligence** - Real cost allocation, not estimates
4. **Evidence Automation** - Auto-generates dispute defense packets
5. **Exception Queue** - Prioritizes issues by financial impact

**This isn't available in Axon, Rose Rocket, or any other TMS.**

## Investment & ROI

**Audit Investment:** $25,000 - $75,000 (one-time)

**Typical ROI:**
- **Immediate:** Recover 3-10x audit cost in first year
- **Ongoing:** Prevent future losses with Revenue Shield service
- **Strategic:** Convert findings into productized modules

**Optional:** Revenue share model for ongoing protection.

---

## Who This Is For

**Ideal clients:**
- Mid-to-large fleets (50+ trucks)
- High ticket volume (1000+ monthly)
- Multiple sites/operations
- History of disputes or compliance issues
- Growth-focused leadership

**Pain points:**
- "We don't know what we don't know"
- "Disputes cost us more than we track"
- "Compliance feels like a guessing game"
- "We need better visibility into profitability"

---

## The Ask

**7 days of read-only data access.**

**What you get:**
- Complete visibility into revenue risks
- Actionable prioritization of issues
- Proof of concept for ongoing protection
- Case study opportunity (if desired)

**What you risk:**
- Nothing. Read-only access. No system changes.

---

## Why Now

**The longer you wait, the more you lose.**

Data quality issues compound:
- Low confidence tickets → Disputes → Lost revenue
- Undetected anomalies → Compliance gaps → Audit exposure
- Operational blind spots → Efficiency losses → Margin erosion

**Every month without visibility costs money.**
