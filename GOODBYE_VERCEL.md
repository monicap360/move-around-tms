# GOODBYE VERCEL! 👋

## Why We Ditched Vercel

- 🐌 **Slow deployments** (5+ minutes vs 30 seconds)
- 💥 **Caching nightmares** that ignore your code changes
- 😤 **Developer frustration** through the roof
- 🚫 **Can't disable their aggressive edge caching**

## New Deployment Strategy

### ✅ Netlify (Recommended)
- Fast deployments (30-60 seconds)
- Sane caching with easy purge
- Better developer experience
- Generous free tier

### ✅ Railway (Alternative)
- Zero-config deployments
- Direct GitHub integration
- No caching issues

### ✅ Local Development (Always works!)
- Instant changes with `npm run dev`
- Perfect for rapid development
- Use ngrok for sharing

## Current Status
- ✅ Code is working locally on localhost:3000
- ✅ Authentication completely removed
- ✅ Build errors fixed
- 🎯 Ready for better deployment platform

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Netlify or Railway
2. Connect custom domain (movearoundtms.com)
3. Never look back at Vercel! 🎉
